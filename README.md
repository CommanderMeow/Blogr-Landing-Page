## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- Javascript



### What I learned

This was the first full Front End Mentor page I had done and it does have issues, somet that i was able to rectify and some I have not gone back and changed due to time limitations. I have learned a lot from doing this page, especially when it comes to absolute position and image placement which had always been a nightmare to me.
Javascript is still very confusing but the more I continue to use it the more I will learn.






### Continued development

As I move forward with front end development, I will be more aware of my use of Id's and classes and which one is more relevant. with this piece I had become focused on using Id's where Classes would of been more appropriate and I left them in as a reminder for future me to be more aware. I'm also terrible at keeping my code DRY which is something I need to try and deal with in future projects.
